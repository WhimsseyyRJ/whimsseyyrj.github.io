Hi! I’m Rijuta Dahal, and I have been making art since I was little. I am currently a senior in high school, and am going to be in college next summer. I have always been an artistic person who always looks for the most creative ways to do anything, whether it’s solve problems, make projects, or even do mundane tasks. My goal is to bring people together through my interest and art and make others creative ideas come to life!
