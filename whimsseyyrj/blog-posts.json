    "content": "Art helps me say things when words don’t. A blank page is where I figure out what I really feel.\n\nCreating feels like sorting through thoughts — deciding what stays and what doesn’t. In the studio, I learn to choose. The canvas shows me where I’m headed.\n\nThis year, I’m slowing down. Letting shapes meet by accident, letting colors surprise me, and treating pauses as part of the process."

    "content": "Perfection shuts things down. Imperfection leaves room to breathe and grow.\n\nA lot of my favorite pieces started as mistakes — a drip, a messy edge, paint where I didn’t plan it. Instead of fixing everything right away, I respond and keep going.\n\nArt reminds me that the 'fixed' places, the little repairs, are part of the story. Those spots show care and attention."

    "content": "Some colors feel like places I’ve been. They show up suddenly, like a warm room in late afternoon.\n\nI keep a small list of colors I notice in real life — brick at sunset, rainy moss, the soft blue of early mornings. When I’m stuck on a piece, I return to that list for inspiration.\n\nMemory is one of my best creative tools."
